### Program/Project Budget(s)

##### Program 1: 1-on-1 Online Tutoring:

###### Summary
This is the core program offered by Learn To Be. Parents/teachers/guardians fill out an in-depth enrollment form describing the need of their K-12 student and why they qualify. If we think it is a good fit, we will accept the family into the Learn To Be tutoring program. 

From here, we publish a student profile for on the Learn To Be website and we broadcast the need to our tutors. Once a tutor feels like their expertise matches with the student need, they can confirm the student and connect with the family via email. 

The family and tutor work out the best day/time(s) for tutoring and on that scheduled day/time the two meet in the Learn To Be virtual classroom where they're able to work on whatever the student needs help with!


###### Budget
$3000

##### Program 2: Online courses/practice modules

###### Summary
We rank very well on Google for many important search terms like 'Online Tutoring' and 'Free Online Tutoring' and this has led to over 60,000 students who have visited our site and have signed up for an account. With our scale, we are unable to accept all of these students for tutoring but we offer a couple of extensive practice modules for them to work on. 

The first is a set of over 400 math exercises in topics ranging from 1-digit addition through advanced calculus. We track all of a students progress and collect relevant information for each problem a student is attempting like how long it is taking them to solve these problems and how many wrong answers they've inputted before a right answer is inputted. We also collect information on how many hints a student is asking for while attempting a problem. We use all of this information and a machine learning algorithm to assess whether we think a student has mastered the concept they are working on. This math exercise module is also integrated into our virtual classroom so that tutors are able to assign problems to students in real time during a tutoring session. This is really powerful because it gives us a better sense of what is occuring during a session and allows tutors to adapt bsaed on whether a student is understanding the material being presented. 

We are really interested in teaching kids how to learn more effectively and as such, we put together a practice module on building a more effective memory. Students work through various memory techniques in order to help them do better in school. We launched this module in October of 2017 and have had hundreds of kids work through it and express an interest in a longer course on memory. 


###### Budget
$500
 
### Annual Organization Budget

### Geographical Area to be Served (or areas)

Nationwide - We have hosted tutoring sessions with students in every state in the United States. Our students primarily come from California, New York, Florida and Texas. 

We have also helped students from families living in South Africa and Iraq as a (very) small pilot to test how well tutoring can be done internationally.
