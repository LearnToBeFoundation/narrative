### Program/Project Budget(s)

##### Program 1: 1-on-1 Online Tutoring:

###### Summary
This is the core program offered by Learn To Be. Parents/teachers/guardians fill out an in-depth enrollment form describing the need of their K-12 student and why they qualify. If we think it is a good fit, we will accept the family into the Learn To Be tutoring program. 

From here, we publish a student profile for on the Learn To Be website and we broadcast the need to our tutors. Once a tutor feels like their expertise matches with the student need, they can confirm the student and connect with the family via email. 

The family and tutor work out the best day/time(s) for tutoring and on that scheduled day/time the two meet in the Learn To Be virtual classroom where they're able to work on whatever the student needs help with!


###### Budget
$3000

##### Program 2: Online courses/practice modules

###### Summary
We rank very well on Google for many important search terms like 'Online Tutoring' and 'Free Online Tutoring' and this has led to over 60,000 students who have visited our site and have signed up for an account. With our scale, we are unable to accept all of these students for tutoring but we offer a couple of extensive practice modules for them to work on. 

The first is a set of over 400 math exercises in topics ranging from 1-digit addition through advanced calculus. We track all of a students progress and collect relevant information for each problem a student is attempting like how long it is taking them to solve these problems and how many wrong answers they've inputted before a right answer is inputted. We also collect information on how many hints a student is asking for while attempting a problem. We use all of this information and a machine learning algorithm to assess whether we think a student has mastered the concept they are working on. This math exercise module is also integrated into our virtual classroom so that tutors are able to assign problems to students in real time during a tutoring session. This is really powerful because it gives us a better sense of what is occuring during a session and allows tutors to adapt bsaed on whether a student is understanding the material being presented. 

We are really interested in teaching kids how to learn more effectively and as such, we put together a practice module on building a more effective memory. Students work through various memory techniques in order to help them do better in school. We launched this module in October of 2017 and have had hundreds of kids work through it and express an interest in a longer course on memory. 


###### Budget
$500
 
### Annual Organization Budget

- Separate attachment

### Geographical Area to be Served (or areas)

Nationwide - We have hosted tutoring sessions with students in every state in the United States. Our students primarily come from California, New York, Florida and Texas. 

We have also helped students from families living in South Africa and Iraq as a (very) small pilot to test how well tutoring can be done internationally.

##### Size
*How is this different than above?*

##### Challenges
One of the key challenges we face is in our vetting of families. Because our programming is entirely online, it is important that we find families who are reliable and who will show up for tutoring every week, as scheduled with their tutor.  This has proven to be quite difficult. As well-intentioned as parents are when they fill out the application, there are issues that arise after they are accepted and connected with a tutor. Some of these are tech issues (they aren't able to load the classroom due to shaky internet connection or lack of digital literacy) and other times life gets in the way and other things take priority over tutoring. A key for us is figuring out which of the families that reaches out fit our mission and are going to be reliable when working with volunteer tutors. 

The second key challenge is ensuring that we connect students with the appropriate tutor. We have had wonderful connections between tutors and students, many of which have resulted in grade improvements in school, confidence boosts for students and a decrease in the burden from a parent already struggling to provide for their kids. But when we have to move tutors away from a student they have been working with, there is a real switching cost in re-broadcasting that student need to our other tutors and transitioning away from the previous tutor. We are looking to better connect tutors with students based on general criteria like whether the student prefers a male or female tutor and whether they prefer a tutor in a specific age range. We will also ask more detailed questions about the subject matter students need help with so tutors can better assess their ability to help.

##### What are the needs and why?
We can talk about how low income parents struggle living paycheck to paycheck and come home after a long days work and are either unwilling or unable to help their kids. We receive applications all the time about parents who are heartbroken over their inability to help their kids with school work. 

They want what's best for their kids and are doing their best, but from an academic perspective, are unable to provide it.  These parents recognize the value of a quality education and that's why they've come to Learn To Be. They can't afford the egregious tutoring costs that many tutoring companies advertising.

### Purpose of Request:
##### What will the funds be used for? (General operating or program grant)

*So is this master narrative built for each grant you're sending out? It seems like this question will be changed.*
*What is a program grant?*

We ask parents in the enrollment form if they are able to pay anything per hour for the tutoring (from $2 per hour to $10 per hour). With our current offering, we are able to sustain our operating costs.  We are receiving $300 every month of recurring revenue.  

But we want to scale our services and this is what the funds will be used for. We want to hire web programmers to help us build more automation into our website that will help us scale our services. 

Right now we manually bill our families at the end of the month and the process of accepting them is still a bit manual.  A web programmer will help us build the features necessary on our site that will allow us to automate these processes so we can focus on finding new families. 


	*EXAMPLES: Hiring new staff, diversifying funding streams, training staff, building websites, marketing, creating new programs, building a donor database, client database, social media campaign, etc.?*

##### What will the funding change, quantitatively and qualitatively?

Quantitatively, the funding will allow us to become a financially independent social enterprise, free of the need to secure grants every year. We are already sustain our operating costs. Funding right now will help us recruit more families, which will help us generate more funding, which will allow us to ultimately hire staff to further scale our operating. And, of course, all of this will help us fulfill our mission of providing more 1-on-1 tutoring to students in need of support. 

*Not sure what to put for qualitative improvements. In this case, I think quantitative improvements are better.*


##### What are the next steps?
	
We will build out two key features on our website:
1. Automate the process of collecting credit card information and charging families for tutoring services received.
2. Automate the process of accepting parent/student applications. 

After we build these two features, we will then be able to turn our focus to marketing our services to every school, non-profit, church across the United States in order to get more families to know about Learn To Be and our tutoring services. 

### Evaluation and Measurement

##### How is the program tracked?
	
1. All of our tutoring sessions are recorded for viewing by parents, students, teachers and Learn To Be administrators.
2. Built into our virtual classroom is a set of math exercises that tutors can assign to students in real-time. We collect data on the student for every problem assigned like how long it is taking them to input an answer and how many wrong answers they input before inputting a correct answer. We use this data and machine learning algorithms to assess whether they have mastered the concept in question. This is an independent way to evaluate the success of a single tutoring session and measure trends of multiple tutoring sessions for a given student. 
3. Post session, we ask tutors and students to fill out a quick qualitative survey. 
4. On the 15th of every month, we send an email to parents asking them to fill out a survey of whether students have seen score/grade improvements in school and if not, if there have been any other improvements that can be noted. 


##### How are the numbers/outcomes evaluated?

Currently, all data is processed internally. Our CEO is a data scientist and has implemented machine learning algorithms to help assess student mastery of concepts that were assigned during tutoring sessions. 

Most of the survey data is qualitative and so cannot be evaluated in a rigorous, statistical way. 

##### Who sees the outcomes and makes decisions regarding reconfiguration or refinement to stay on goal?

We are 100% transparent with every piece of data to every stakeholder at Learn To Be. This means that parents, students, staff, board members and the public are able to view every survey left for every tutoring session hosted. You can find this information at [https://learntobe.org/impact](https://learntobe.org/impact)

### Future Planning/Strategic Plan

##### One year plan?

For 2018, the goal is to get $1000 of recurring revenue to Learn To Be. On average, families pay $8/month. This means that we will need to have 125 families we are working with. 

##### Three year plan?

In three years, the goal is to have 1000 families working with Learn To Be every month. With an average payment of $8/month, this will allow us to collect $8000 per month of revenue. We are confident that with our implementation of automation into website, we will be able to reach this goal since we can focus exclusively on recruiting families and marketing to families through a variety of channels. 


##### Five year plan?

In five years, the goal is to have 5000 families working with Learn To Be every month. With an average payment of $8/month, this will allow us to collect $40000 per month of revenue. We are confident that with our implementation of automation into website, we will be able to reach this goal since we can focus exclusively on recruiting families and marketing to families through a variety of channels.

### Major Funders (2015-16)

None for 2017

### Leverage Funding Statement (explain the funding streams and ratio)

##### What is the immediate and long range plan for financial sustainability?

Our operating costs to keep the Learn To Be site up and running for parents and tutors is very small. At our current scale, it costs us $3500 to run Learn To Be. We generate about $300 per month of recurring revenue from the parents we currently work with and so we are a fully sustained organization. 

But in order to scale, we know that we need to hire more staff. This staff can help us spread the word about Learn To Be, get more families to enroll and help us generate more funding. This is our long term plan for financial sustainability. 

##### What is the breakdown on where the funding comes from:
###### Government - 0%
###### Fees - 20%
###### Scholarships - 0%
###### Foundations - 5%
###### Corporations - 0%
###### In-kind Giving - 75%

### Comparable Programs
##### Who else is doing 1-on-1 online tutoring the way Learn To Be is?

To my knowledge, the only company that does tutoring similar to Learn To Be is TutorChatLive. The difference is that their service is only through chat and does not involve a virtual classroom. This severely limits the efficacy of their tutoring because it is difficult to teach, for example, advanced algebra techniques via chat message only. 

Organizations like the Khan Academy are a great educational service, but provide only pre-recorded videos. These are not well-suited for the demographic that Learn To Be is targeting.  Often times, Learn To Be works with students are who many grade levels behind and these one-size-fits-all videos just don't work for them. The students we work with need individualized help and that's what we are going to provide them with.
