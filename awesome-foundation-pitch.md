Education should not be dictated by circumstance. 

And yet, for over 34 million underserved students throughout the nation, circumstances are depriving them of quality parental guidance, peer support, and the resources needed to thrive academically.

That’s where Learn To Be comes in.
 
Learn To Be is a non-profit bringing free, 1-on-1, online tutoring to underserved communities around the nation.  We partner with schools and other non-profits to bring individualized education to K-12 students in STEM, reading, and writing. In particular, we work with homeless students and students receiving free or reduced price lunch at school. 

Over the past five years, we have paired over 600 volunteer tutors with students and hosted over 30,000 sessions in a virtual classroom we developed.  This virtual classroom is a lot like Skype or Google Hangouts, but more powerful.  In addition to built-in audio/video capabilities, it has a whiteboard area where students and tutors can share ideas, upload documents, and make annotations. Moreover, each session is recorded and stored on our servers, providing students with hours of personalized content to recall. 

So far, we have partnered with 12 schools around the nation because we know this model works: During a pilot program at Dorris Place Elementary in East LA, teachers saw an average score increase of 22% on a state-mandated periodic assessment exam after only eight weeks of tutoring 2 hours per week.

We’re not offering any quick fixes or grand solutions. Just a push towards an ideal: Individualized attention for every student who needs it.

A grant from The Awesome Foundation would bring us one step closer to that goal.
