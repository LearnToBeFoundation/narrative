Baleigh is a wonderful little second grader, living with her single mother, Selena, in a city where the median income is $20,000.  Selena is like any other parent: working full time to provide for her daugther and wanting nothing but the best for her. 

That includes her education. 

But with her work schedule and _____, she just isn't able to support her student's needs in school. 

And so Selena reached to Learn To Be, our non-profit that brings 1-on-1, online tutoring to K-12 underserved youth around the nation. In her application, she wrote:

*Baleigh is in the 2nd grade and she is such a lovable young lady that loves to learn. From kindergarten to 1st grade Baleigh has done well in all subjects but reading has always been the subject that she had to work extra hard at. Now that she is in 2nd grade she is having a hard time in reading fluency so that frustrates her and that makes her confidence go down. I just want her to be the best she can and get any help she can get. I wish I could afford to pay for a tutor but it is just not in my finances.*

Baleigh came to us with with scores hovering around 50% in reading. We paired her with Seena, a wonderful tutor from Austin, Texas who recently graduated college. Seena met with Baleigh and her family over email where they worked out the best day and time for tutoring. They started working together in the Learn To Be virtual classroom, which functions a lot like Google Hangouts or Skype but with more tutoring friendly functionality. 

And the two really hit it off!

We consistently receive survey results from Seena that looked like something like this: 

*I wrote sentences that had her spelling words in them and she read them so well! After she read the sentences, I quizzed her on her spelling words and she was able to spell all of her spelling words with little to no help. I am so proud of her and truly look forward to working with her every week. She has so much energy and loves to read and write so tutoring her is always a blast!*

And near the end of their tutoring, Seena mentioned to us: 

*Today Baleigh read a story with little assistance! I had to tell her that next week was going to be our last and sadly, she started to cry but I told her next week, I'll have something fun planned. I will definitely miss her!*

How like is it that a young student from Georgia and a young college grad from Texas are able to connect in such a meaningful way? 

But what about the most important part of this process, the actual tutoring? Was it effective and was Baleigh improving? 

Yes!

After only 9 hours of work together, Baleighs's test scores moved from 50% to 88%! And according to her mother, she has a newfound love of reading! But in addition, Selena also felt relief from knowing that her daughter was getting the school support she was unable to provide. 

The story of Baleigh's family is one of 200 that we have paired right now. 

200 families struggling around the nation and looking to get support for their students are working with 200 amazing volunteer tutors comprised of high school students, college students and young professionals. 

And we're seeing results. 90% of our students see a 7% increase in scores after about 10 hours of work together. But more importantly, feedback we receive is showing that students are feeling more confident and parents are feeling more relieved. And in a countries where families are feeling the pinch in all facets of their life, we feel proud that we're helping lift some of the burden off of these parents. 

Over the last year, we've stepped away and tried to reassess how we ocan sustain ourselves. We have come back as a social enterprise! In our student application, we now ask parents if they're willing to pay any hourly fee for the tutoring. 

With a small pilot we've run over the last several months, we are pulling in about $250 per month from our tutoring. The annual operating costs of running Learn To Be is about $3500 and so we are nearly financially sustainble!

So why are we reaching out for funding? 

Because we know that we can scale our operation to not just help 200 families, but to help 2000 and 20000 families with a little bit of help. We're proud of the website we've built but we know we can automate more processes if we can hire a web programmer to help. We have a current tutor cohort of over 1500 individuals and it is consistently growing. We don't have enough students to meet the demand of tutors and with the ability to hire a programmer to take care of the website, we can focus our efforts on spreading the word about Learn To Be and helping more students like Baleigh. 

Weâ€™re not offering any quick fixes or grand solutions. Just a push towards an ideal: Individualized attention for every student who needs it.

A grant from <INSERT> will bring us one step closer to that goal.
